MediaZ grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to privately use, reproduce, display, perform, and modify the Licensed Technology in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (the “License”). This means that as long as you are not violating this Agreement (such as by exceeding the Instance limitation stated in Section 4(a)) or applicable law, you can privately use the Licensed Technology however you want, including to develop Products. By “Products” we mean products, services, or any other projects that either (a) are made using any Licensed Technology or (b) combine any Licensed Technology with any other software or content.
